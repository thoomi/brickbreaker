## Brickbreaker
Brickbreaker is a simple 2D game running in the console and developed in C++. It was built during a games programming course at my university and it features a lot concepts also suited for much bigger games. To just name a few:
* MVC architecture
* Entity system
* State system
* Command pattern
* ...

This list is not complete and maybe in the future i will write some blog posts about the concepts, algorithms and thoughts which lead to all of those decisions. :)
